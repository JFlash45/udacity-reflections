Initializing a repository (git init) adds a .git folder which contains metadata associated with the repository.  It must be done so that the appropriate data is in place when the repository is committed.

The staging area is used to prepare the files you want to commit to the repository.  The working directory may contain more files than you want to commit.  Staging them allows you to commit only the files you want.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
git status will help you see what is staged for a commit.  Running fit diff --staged will identify the changes in the staged files and the current repository so you can see exactly what will be committed.
