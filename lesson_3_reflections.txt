When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository might be useful if you want your to collaborate with others on your work.  Allowing others to view and comment on your work may lead to better results.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
For similar reasons on why to make commits at certain time, you probably want to only pull changes at certain logical points rather than automatically syncing at a specified time.  It may not make sense to pull some changes at those times and may lead to confusion as the current state of your project.
